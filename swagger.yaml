      description: |
                    This method is a starting point for any communication with AppGrid APIs and is used to generate a
                    session key. A session could be created either by passing parameters via query string or headers. If the
                    header approach is chosen, both X-Application-Key and X-User-Id HTTP headers must be provided.

                    <b>Note:</b> AppGrid does not support mixing of header and query string parameters for this method.
                    Application should keep track of the session expiration time and either re-create the session when itâ€™s
                    about to expire, or handle session response about invalid/expired session.
